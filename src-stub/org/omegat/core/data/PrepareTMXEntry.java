 * Class for prepare TMXEntry content before save unchangeable copy in the ProjectTMX. We can't use just
 * parameters in the setTranslation() method since count of parameters is too much. Structure of this class is
 * almost the save like TMXEntry.
 * 
 * Instead, we will set all parameters into this class, then ProjectTMX will convert in into TMXEntry than
 * save internally.
